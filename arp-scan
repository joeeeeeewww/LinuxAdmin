arp-scan is used to detect ipaddress of host in lan:

arp-scan -I interface -l  	--> using arp-scan
example arp-scan -I vboxnet0 -l

Since arp-scan is noisy which means its easily detected , you can use
netdiscover.
netdiscover -i vboxnet0
netdiscover -i vboxnet0 -r 192.168.0.0/24	--> scan entire subnet , r=range 
use -p for passive scanning
