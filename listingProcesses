LISTING PROCESSES COMMANDS:

ps	-- means process status
ps -e   -- display all process
ps -f   -- full format listing(with detailed info)
ps -ef	-- all process with detailed info
ps -ef | wc -l	-- to see no of running processes
Note: daemons are processes that run in the background and not interactive
ps -aux	-- another way
ps aux --sort=%mem | less	-- to sort processes
ps -f -u user	-- to display processes of a user
ps -ef | grep sshd	-- to search sshd in the currently running processes
NOte: when using grep along with ps, it might display an output which you have typed but not an existing process.Grep has just selected itself in the processes
Hence its better to use pgrep command.
Example: pgrep sshd
or pgrep -l sshd	-- to display PID and the process
pgrep -l -u joe sshd	-- use -u for processes owned by a user
pstree	-- displays a tree of processes
