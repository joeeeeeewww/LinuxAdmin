command substitution --> running a shell command and store its output to a variable for later use.

Example now="`date`"  --> one way to do it is using backtick.Here the date command is substituted by its output

Example2 users="$(who)"  --> 2nd way by using $()

Another example :  output="$(ps -ef | grep bash)"
echo "$output"

Another one : tar -csvf etc-$(date +%F_%H%M).tar.gz
