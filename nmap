nmap ipaddressOfOtherMachine	--> scan using nmap
or
nmap -sT ipaddressOfOtherMachine

#config file for ssh = /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# to check which port ssh is listening
netstat -tupan | grep ssh

When service is on non-standard port it cant be detected by -sT option.
It can be detected by command nmap -p ipaddress:newport  ipaddress only that the service listening to the port will display unknown.

To resolve run: nmap -sV ipaddress  --> V for service detection
To scan all ports: nmap -p- ipaddress
To scan udp ports: nmap -sU ipaddress
To perform icmp ping scan use -sn or -sP options
